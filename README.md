### About Me
---
Welcome! My name is Larry Schwall. I am a software developer based in New Orleans, La. 

I have over 6 years of experience with Html5 and CSS3, a little over 5 years with JavaScript, and 2+ years of react and Angular. Alongside my experience in Web Dev, I have a little over a year with C++ in the Arduino engineering workspace alongside countless years of technology hardware experience!

Outside of work, I have a passion for the expanding my culinary skills and diving into the retro futurism art spaces.
